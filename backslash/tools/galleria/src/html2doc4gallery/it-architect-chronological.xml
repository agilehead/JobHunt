                I was involved in the Modeling and Design of the Application. The application
                was deployed a full month ahead of schedule, and has consistently achieved 99.9%
                uptime. We reduced overall effort by relying on Object Relational Mappers
                (Hibernate) and a suite of Code-Generation tools. This also reduced bugs and
                consequently, the downtime averages.
