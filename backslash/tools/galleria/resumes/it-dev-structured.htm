        Experience</h2>
    <h3>
        Intercom Business Systems (IBS) - May 2007 - To Date</h3>
    <h4>
        Stock Trading and Analysis System (STAS2)
    </h4>
    <p>
        STAS2 is an evolution of the company's leading stock trading product STAS. STAS2
        now transacts US $12.5 billion/day, in worldwide transaction volume. With more than
        2000 concurrent users (a 300% increase over the previous version), the project presented
        challenges in performance and scalability. Total team size was over 50.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>BEA AquaLogic for SAP, Oracle Apps Integration</li>
        <li>Java/J2EE, Struts for the Web Platform, extensive use of AJAX using jQuery</li>
        <li>Oracle 9i Database Backend</li>
        <li>Code reviews,Test-Case and Code Coverage audits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I was part of the team that designed the Web System (including UI development and
        AJAX) and integration with BEA Middleware. Apart from coding, my role involved interviewing
        the end-users, co-ordination with customers&#39; technical teams, reviewing code
        and our JUnit test-suite for coverage.</p>

        <li>Web Services backend, connects with IBS Trading Analysis Mainframe (IBM Z-Series)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I was involved in the Modeling and Design of the Application. The application was
        deployed a full month ahead of schedule, and has consistently achieved 99.9% uptime.
        We reduced overall effort by relying on Object Relational Mappers (Hibernate) and
        a suite of Code-Generation tools. This also reduced bugs and consequently, the downtime
        averages.</p>
