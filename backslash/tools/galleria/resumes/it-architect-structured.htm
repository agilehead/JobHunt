    <p>
        Reverb Moon is a Television broadcasting company with over 5 Million customers &amp;
        10 Satellites, broadcasting over 500 Channels around the world. Claims Entry System
        is a full life cycle application in J2EE/Java developed for retailers to Create,
        Update, Delete and Reprint Claims. This Application uses multi-tier java architecture
        with BEA-Web Logic Application Server on the middle tier. This application will
        handle more volume of transactions compared to the existing Claims application running
        on ASP (Active Server Pages) and Visual Basic Script.

        We reduced overall effort by relying on Object Relational Mappers (Hibernate) and
        a suite of Code-Generation tools. This also reduced bugs and consequently, the downtime
        averages.</p>
